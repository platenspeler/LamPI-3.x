<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>A little background on the Arduio project to start with. For a long time I was convinced that we could do with a Raspberry system in all situations: The Raspberry was a perfect workhorse to do database pocessing and other compute intensive stuff and it would run a standard version of Linux. And because of its low price of around 35 Euro for the Raspberry version 2, who would be looking for any other system to build a Home Automation (HA) system.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that the Raspberry does have some trouble with interrupt intensive loads and it's timing is not accurate enough to provide real-time like experience. Also, the price of a lean-and-mean Arduino is just 2.50 Euro for an Arduino model Nano. So why not use that system as a gateway handling all transmitter/receiver interrupts? And it's timing is far better....</p>
<p>So I decided to buy myself 2 of these Arduino Nano machines and connect hem to my LamPI system as an alternative to direct connected transmitter/receiver parts. It turns out the even with the cheapest transmitter/receiver pair connected (we're talking about sub 1 Euro for a pair) the Arduino does better than the Raspberry in almost every situation.</p>
<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>The Arduino Nano, ordered on eBay for $2.55 , arrived within a week in our mailbox. As I ordered the Arduino without any other cables, power supply etc. the package was only small. The Arduino was packaged in an anti-static bag which told me to be careful with the device as long as it was not connected to any PC or other device with grounding.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>
<p>First of all, assuming you do development on your PC like I do, make sure you download the Windows developer environment for the Arduino and install it on your PC. There is a good tutorial available on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/windows</li>
  <li>https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the description, download the software, install it and read on ...</p>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>In order to download te LamPI firmware on your Arduino we first need to make sure that your Arduino is connected to the PC correctly. Th Arduino documentation decribes a very simple process</p>
<h2>Connect 433 Transmitter/Receiver</h2>
<p>In order to use the Arduino as a 433MHz gateway you need to connect your transmitter and/or receiver hardware to the Arduino system. This is a simple and straightforward process.</p>
<h2>More serious - Firmware</h2>
<p>In order to use the Arduino as a LamPI gateway, you need at least the following components:</p>
<p>- Arduino Nano plus development environment (to load the firmware)<br />
- A PC system (or if you want your Raspberry) to do the firmware loading<br />
- The firmware from Gitbub: http://www.github.com/platenspeler choose Arduino Gateway</p>
<p> <br />
  - Your Raspberry machine</p>
<p>Download the Arduino firmware and unpack the file in the Arduino library. By default this is in&nbsp;the&nbsp;arduino directory that is created for every library user in his own home directory. Restart you Arduino and restart the development environment on your PC. If you now choose &lt;FILE&gt;&lt;EXAMPLES&gt; than the LamPI library should show up on the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Now select &lt;LamPI&gt; library and then &lt;Transceiver433&gt;. Click on the top of your page on the right arrow to compile the file and send it to your Arduino.</p>
