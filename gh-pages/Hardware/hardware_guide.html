<h1>Interfacing 433MHz devices</h1>
<p>There are several ways to interface LamPI with 433MHz devices. First of all, one can connect a transmitter and/or reeiver directly to the RaspberryPI. This is the cheapest solution. Secondly, you can buy&nbsp; dedicated interface such as the Rfxcomm that connets to the Raspberry over a&nbsp;USB interface. This devices will do most if not all low-level processing for the Raspberry. And thirdly, you can make your own solution with for example an Adruino and build your own device for transmitting and receiving 433MHz messages. so what are the pro's nd conn's?</p>
<h2>Direct connect to Raspberry</h2>
<p>A direct connection to the RaspberryPI is the cheapest solution to connect (over the air) your Raspberry homeautomation solution to devices in the field. The disadvantage of using the Raspberry this way is that the Raspbarry will spend a lot of Cpu cycles on handling interrupts of the 433MHz receiver, even if there are no useful signals received. Also, some messages are long, or have very critical timing, and the Raspberry will not receive these signls well if it has other important thing to do.</p>

<p>Transmitting commands is less of an issue: Especially for transmissions&nbsp;to Kaku devices, the Raspberry seems to be quite capable. If one or two interrupts (with high priority) do occurr, they will not influence the transmitter timing too much. The&nbsp;Kaku protocol is not that difficult in timing. However, for Livolo and Kopou devices that do use far shorting timing cycles, the Raspberry is not the best solution. Especially when there is lots of other work to be done by the Raspberry such as Gui handling, Daemon handling with MySQL and 433MHz receiver handling. </p>
<h2>Using an Rfxcomm interface</h2>
<p itemprop="name">The rfxcomm RFXtrx433E USB 433.92MHz transceiver is the standard communication device for several commercial and non-commercial home automation solutions.&nbsp;It is a separate device which is connected to teh Raspberry over a USB cable&nbsp;(which will also power it). The advantage of the Rfxcomm solution is its support of a wide range of sensors and switches that is available in the market. Also, it's manufacturer will actively integrate new devices when they become available on the market. The disadvantage of this solution: It's price is steep, 105 Euro's is more than the Raspberry and&nbsp;a few sensors...</p>

<h2>Building your own USB Device</h2>
<p>The third option would be to combine most of the advantages of&nbsp;1 and 2 and build your own 433MHz gateway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>LamPI Choice</h2>
<p>For the moment, LamPI supports the first approach only. The rfxcom solution would probably work (after some work) but is not tested because of the potential cost.</p>
<p>In the future, I will do some work on option 3 and try whether an USB solution based on a dedicated Arduino 433MHz gateway over USB can be used as well.</p>

<p><img src="images/GPIOs.png" width="254" height="581" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="left">The Raspberry-PI has a 26-pins connector (called P1) to which all devices are connected, whether these are 434MHz transmitters/receivers, 1-wire sensors, I2C-bus sensors or the P1-connector of the Smart Meter in your house.</p>
<p>The figure on the left shows the lay-out of the RaspberryPI GPIO connector. For the 512MB version Raspberry (which is the most common version sold and in use today) use the rev 2.</p>
<p>If you look at the table more closely you'll notice that some sensors, transmitters or receivers use the same pins. This is for historical reasons, when I first started the LamPI project. At the moent I would make choices that ensure that we can use as many transmitters, receivers and sensors next to each other. </p>
<p>Note: Therefore I expect to make some changes to the default pin for the transnmitter (header pin 8) as I cannot change the pin layout of the Razberry. So in a next release of LamPI it could very well be that the default pin for the LamPI transmitter will be GPIO17 or so.</p>

As I use the wiringPI library of Gordon, I also copied his pin-definitions which include the WiringPi numbering (being different from the GPIO pin id's). Please note that some GPIO id's used in the name colun do not correspond to the general naming convention found on the internet. For example, hardware pin 12, is called either PCM_CLK or GPIO18 on most pages, but Gordon called it GPIO 01.</p>
<p><br>
  NOTE: As you can see in the table above, the 433 sensors in their current setup overlap with the Razberry device. This makes that both systems need to be on a separate RaspberryPI as they share pin connectors. <br>

<h2>Raspberry B 1+ and B2 pinout</h2>
<p>The pin-out for the new Raspberry devices is different from the older ones. The new connector is 40-pi instead of 26-pin. Fortunately the first 26-pins are equal between all the B versions of the RaspberryPI.</p>

<h1><a name="433transceivers"></a>433MHz Transmitters and Receivers</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>How to make the RaspberryPI a transmitter/receiver device for 433MHz? It is probably simpler than you thinkt. Apart from the PI itself you need two really cheap small pieces of hardware, some solder and wires and a little time to put it together. So what you need are a small transmitter board and a receiver board. These boards are sold on eBay, Aliexpress and some internet shops for prices ranging from 2 $ a pair to 20$ for a receiver. In my experience, both cheap and more expensive boards work OK, if have both.</p>
<p>I found that most ASK/OOK based transmitters and receivers work with the 433MHz devices that are used for home automation. The protocol used by klikaanklikuit (Kaku) is OOK.</p>
<h2>Cheap eBay Transmitters and Receivers</h2>
<p>In the picture you see a receiver (L) and transmitter (R) pair that can be bought for around 3$ a pair wih free shipping. It is Chinese made, and although specifications might differ from unit to unit, they work quite OK.</p>
<p><img src="images/pi transmitter receiver.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>Frankly, I love these sets as for just 10$ I can make at least 5 prototype boards and see which one fits my PI better. </p>
<p><img src="images/vmstat_cheapebay_noload.JPG" width="893" height="529"></p>
<h2>Superheterodyne kit (eBay)</h2>
<p>Ok, these look better than the cheap kit, and the good news is that they are better. </p>
<p><img src="images/super-heterodyne-pair.JPG" width="674" height="555"></p>
<p>And the load of these superheterodyne kits so low enough that futher work with low pass filters etc may not be necessary anymore. As you can see, with my setup (somewhere in 2014) the idle time is around 85% which means that the Raspberry (model 1) has plenty of time left. Obeviously for this test I did not run any other functions of LamPI in order to be able to compare these results.</p>
<p><img src="images/vmstat_superheterodyne_noload.JPG" width="893" height="549"></p>
<p>As you can see from the screendump of a terminal to one of my PIs, the load of the transmitter/receiver combo on the system (no GUI actions, only LamPI-daemon running, system receiving weather station (WT-440u) messages only) is very low. If you compare the load of this set with the cheap one above you see that it uses less than half of the cpu power that the cheap kit uses.</p>
<p>For your final version, where you need to rely on in your house, this may be a safe choice of transmitter/receiver.</p>
<h2>iPrototype</h2>
<p>The Dutch internetshop iPrototype also sells transmitters and receivers  and their quality is very good, and comparable to the Superheterodyne set described above..</p>

<h2>FSK (Won't Work)</h2>
<p>I bought a set of FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) transmitter/receivers as an alternative to separate tranmitter/receiver sets. These work in a FSK environment only and are <strong>NOT</strong> usable for Klikaankliuit communication. Kiku modules wiork with a different type of modulation, based on  ASK (amplitude-shift keying) or OOK (OOK is On Off Keyking, an ASK variant with 100% amplitude modulation, so on or off). <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>Especially the receivers can pick up quite some noise, expecially in an urban area. I have been experimenting with external filters that would keep the higher-frequency crap from my receiver, and some people like those in pilight for example make an art of building a filter around those components. Thing is that with all those sensors in and around the house there is a lot of pollution which will impact the receiver. Not only will it make our received not recognize incoming messages if two transmitters send their data at the same time, it will also impact the amount of compute power needed to clearly recognize messages coming in if there is lots of noise in the air.</p>
<p>During my experiments I found out that with good software design the system time that these receivers use for interrupt handling can be kept close to 10-30% max, which leaves about 75% idle time that can be used for LamPI-node processing and GUI handling. I use a round buffer where pulses received by the received are stored and processed as soon as enough pulses came in to recognize a message.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the more expensive units work slightly better and consume less computer resources too, so I advice all of you to spend a little more money and buy the more expensive stuff</p>
<ul>
  <li>More expensive receivers contain better filters, pick up less noise, and leave you with more compute power</li>
  <li>More expensive transmitters have a better range and will make the devices in your house recognize commands easier.</li>
</ul>
